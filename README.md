## RECOMMENDATION
- The North is known for its high population and has the least housing scheme, so more housing schemes should be available in the Northeast and West regions.
- There is a total of 36 States in Nigeria which only 25 states are represented in the dataset which shows how fictitious it is.
- More data needs to be collected to know how large a family is
